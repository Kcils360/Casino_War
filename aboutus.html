          <p>I am Han and I hope you had fun playing our game! Originally a chemist in the chemical industry, I have synthesized things from Nobel-Price winning olefin catalysis to your daily food additive, I was tired of the repeativess in following a set of procedures a certain chemical. In desperate of applying my creativity I discovered that the IT field might just be what I am looking for, ever since I was determined to become a software developer! The other reason being chemicals can be very hazardous to you...  </p>

            <p>Hello! My name is Duane Rush and thank you for visiting our site. I am a former biologist gone software developer. I was born in Tacoma and raised in Gig Harbor until the end of second grade. Then my family moved to the Palm Springs area of California until we moved back to Washington after I was out of High School. I obtained my bachelors degree in Cell Biology from Central Washington University and after graduating worked a job that showed me that this was not the path I wanted my life to take. So now here I am at code fellows! Some other cool facts about me would be that I love animals, video games, most things nerdy as well as being on the water as much as possible. </p>
